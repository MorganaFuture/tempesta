/**
 * Class for sending records to a Clickhouse database.
 * It manages multiple instances of the Clickhouse client (one per thread) to
 * handle concurrent operations, as the Clickhouse client itself is not
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * Constructor:
 *    @TfwClickhouse - Initializes the Clickhouse connection for each CPU core,
 *        setting up individual clients and data blocks, with a provided callback.
 *
 * Other public methods:
 *    @getBlock - Returns a pointer to the data block for the specified CPU core.
 *    @commit - Commits the data in the block to the Clickhouse database if the
 *        elapsed time since the last insertion exceeds a predefined threshold
 *        or the blockâ€™s row count exceeds a maximum event threshold. After
 *        committing, the block is deleted, a new block is created via
 *        block_callback and last_time is updated.
 *
 * Private Members:
 *    @client - Clickhouse Client instance for sending data to the database.
 *    @block - Block instance holding data records to be inserted.
 *    @last_time - The last timestamp when data was sent.
 *    @block_callback - Callback function that creates a new Block for data
 *        storage.
 *    @table_name - Name of the Clickhouse table where data is inserted.

/**
 * TfwColumnFactory is a factory class for creating objects of classes derived

 * column objects depending on the type required, simplifying column handling
 * for different data types.
 *
 * Constructor:
 *    @TfwColumnFactory - Initializes a mapping from `Type::Code` values to
 *        corresponding column creation functions. This mapping links specific
 *        type codes (e.g., `Type::UInt8`, `Type::IPv4`) to functions that
 *        instantiate columns of the appropriate derived type.
 *
 * Public Method:
 *    @create - Creates and returns a shared pointer to a column object based
 *        on the provided type code. Looks up the map_ for a matching function
 *        pointer for the specified code.
 *
 * Private Member:
 *    @map_ - A map associating Type::Code enums with function pointers.
