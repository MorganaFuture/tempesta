# Motivation

For enhancement issues (a new feature request) need to describe why the feature
must be implemented. E.g. the feature is required to support a widespread web
framework or browser. References to the real life cases are appreciated.

Features, simplifying a popular use cases, improving performance and/or
simplifying the Tempesta FW architecture are appreciated.

We do not take into the scope features just because they are supported by other
web accelerator or described in an RFC.

# Scope
